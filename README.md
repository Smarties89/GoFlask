GoFlask

A University assignment to create a HTTP server

Remark that this was just an **assignment**. I decided to try to make it in Go, since **I had no idea what Go is** and how it works. Therefore it **does not reflect pretty code, good practices, or anything else good** - it was just  used to solve a exam exercise in a interesting new language.
